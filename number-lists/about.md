# About

This contains code for scanning in multiple lists of numbers.

The first line contains a number `m`. `m` cases follow, with each case consisting of two lines:

- A number `t` on the first line
- `t` numbers follow on the next line.

`t` can be ignored but helps get the input in Java and C++.
